Brain tumors are highly dangerous and diagnosing them quickly is critical for successful treatment. However, detecting and classifying brain tumors is very difficult since they can be ambiguously defined within soft brain tissues. Typically magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT) scans, and ultrasound images are used to evaluate brain tumors. But thoroughly analyzing these scans takes a lot of time and effort.
To address this, propose automating the process of brain tumor detection and segmentation from MRI scans using deep learning. The goal is to bridge the gap between initial diagnosis and pinpointing actual tumors, by providing doctors with a quick, non-invasive automated second opinion.
Specifically, their technique uses transfer learning with Residual Networks (ResNet) to detect the presence of tumors. It then segments the MRI scan using ResUNet to delineate the precise tumor area. This demonstrates deep learning's potential to efficiently process and analyze medical images. The automated tumor detection and segmentation could assist clinical evaluation and help speed up treatment for this extremely dangerous condition.
